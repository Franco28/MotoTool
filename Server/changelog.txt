CHANGELOG 
----------------

-----------------------------------
v2.4 - Released Jul 26, 2020
-----------------------------------
- [info] MotoLogoMaker re-born!
- [new] Added new Moto devices!

------------------------------------
Version 2.3 - Released Oct 19, 2015
------------------------------------
- [new] Added Moto X Play, Moto X Style (Pure), and Moto G 3rd Gen to device list.
- Moto X Play has a 6 MiB logo.bin size
- Moto X Style (Pure) has a 8 MiB logo.bin size

------------------------------------
Version 2.2 - Released Sept 15, 2014
------------------------------------
- [new] Metadata added to created logo.bin files - The following data is present.
- Version of this program that created the bin file. (was present since Version 2.0)
- Motorola Device Selected
- Motorola Device Resolution
- User Comment

------------------------------------
Version 2.1 - Released Sept 9, 2014
------------------------------------
- [new] Default logo_charge image predefined, where applicable.
- [new] logo_boot and logo_unlocked are now linked together, unless you load different images for each of them.
- [new] Duplicate images loaded no longer wastes space in logo.bin

------------------------------------
Version 2.0 - Released Sept 8, 2014
------------------------------------
- [new] Last selected device is now remembered between sessions.
- [new] Added in Moto G 2nd Gen. (2nd gen does not have a logo_charge in its current firmware.)
- [new] Added in Moto X 2nd Gen. (Larger screen in Moto X 2nd Gen, logo_charge and logo_lowpower present. The one thing that bugs me, is that motorola did not expand the logo partition size, still retains it at 4MiB for that device, so one is pretty limited in full screen picture complexity.)
- [fixed] Fixed a few bugs that were introduced in Version 1.9

------------------------------------
Version 1.9 - Released Sept 3, 2014
------------------------------------
- [new] Added in the stock images for logo_battery, logo_lowpower, and logo_unplug, that the program will put into the logo.bin, if you don't specify a custom logo for these images.

------------------------------------
Version 1.8 - Released Aug 30, 2014
------------------------------------
- [changed] Turns out Moto G as of the Android Kitkat 4.4.4 OTA update supports logo_charge. Updated accordingly, and put a note in the tool tips on its use case.

------------------------------------
- [changed] Big performance boost of saving logo.bin/flashable zips.

------------------------------------
Version 1.6 - Released Aug 22, 2014
------------------------------------
- [fixed] Fixed a null reference bug that happens if you switch logo.bin versions right from program startup, as well as a few other potential null reference bugs.

------------------------------------
- [changed] More improvements to the logo compression algorithm.
- [new] Added Landscape mode

------------------------------------
Version 1.4 - Released Aug 17, 2014
------------------------------------

- [fixed] Corrected a bug in 540x540 color encoding/decoding.
- [fixed] Corrected a bug where if 540x540 formats were selected, and you didn't pick an image for at least one of the logos, the process would error out with an exception.

- [changed] Process of creating zip/bin now outright aborts if there was an error loading every image loaded in the process.
- [changed] An opportunity to abort the process is presented if you try to save bin/zip with no images loaded.
- [new] Tool tips now added on the tree nodes for logo_boot, logo_battery, and logo_unlocked. As I do not have a Moto E, I cannot determine what causes logo_lowpower and logo_unplug to show, to be able to advise on these.
- [new] logo.bin and flashable zips can be dragged and dropped onto the application.
